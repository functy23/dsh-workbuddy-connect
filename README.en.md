# DSH WorkBuddy Connect

English | [中文](./README.md)

Brings every model in the WorkBuddy desktop app (GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, DeepSeek-V4-Pro, DeepSeek-V4-Flash, Kimi-K3, MiniMax-M3, Hy3, and more) straight into [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) — zero configuration in the DSH chat.

Both the CN **WorkBuddy** and the international **WorkBuddy AI** apps are supported (international support since **v0.5.0**): whichever one you have installed shows up as its own model group, and having both installed shows both, each with its own account and credit.

## Features

- **Works out of the box**: install and enable the plugin, then use it directly in DSH — no extra configuration.

- **CN and international side by side**: the CN app appears as the **WorkBuddy** group and the international one as **WorkBuddy AI**. Their models, accounts, and credit never mix — each keeps its **own account pool**. Settings likewise shows **one card per version**, each with its own accounts and balance.

  Whether a group appears depends on whether **its account pool is empty**, not on whether the desktop app is currently signed in. Once you sign in to the desktop app, the account is recorded in the pool and kept; the group then keeps working even after the desktop app signs out, because the plugin holds the credential.

- **Image input**: most models accept images — paste or drop one straight into the conversation (GLM-5.3-Flash, GLM-5.2, the DeepSeek-V4 series, and more); the few text-only models (e.g. GLM-5.1) clearly say so.

- **Reasoning levels**: levels explicitly declared by WorkBuddy appear directly — for example, GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-Flash offer low / high / max. For some models that do not declare selectable levels, Web and Desktop provide a **Reasoning levels** control in the model picker for a manual check. It sends a few requests and may consume credit. Models without a check result or selectable levels continue to use WorkBuddy's default.

- **Status and detection**: Settings → Plugins → the matching card shows the account, token validity, remaining credit, and model offers. It also lets you refresh the model list manually and shows whether the current list came from the upstream or from the built-in fallback, and provides manual reasoning-level detection for eligible models.


- **Multi-account rotation (since v0.6.0)**: each version can hold several accounts at once, and requests rotate between them automatically. When an account is rate limited (429), out of quota (402), or has an expired sign-in (401), the request is **retried on another account in the pool**, so the conversation does not break. Each healthy account is tried at most once per request — never an unbounded retry loop.

  A limited account is set aside and the card shows "rate limited · retry in N min"; an out-of-quota account is set aside much longer (one hour, doubling on each consecutive failure, capped at 24 hours) and recovers on its own. When the upstream sends `Retry-After`, that value wins.

  Accounts come from two places: **the desktop app's sign-in is captured automatically**, and you can **add more by QR** from the card (scan with the phone app; the sign-in joins the plugin only and does not touch the desktop app).


### Managing accounts

Settings → **DSH-WorkBuddy** (its own entry in the settings navigation):

The page is **one card**, with the accounts above and the models below.

The **accounts** block holds both products in a single list, each row carrying
a small grey label under the name saying which product it belongs to
(**WORKBUDDY** / **WORKBUDDY AI**) — the one fact that must not be guessed,
since the two products’ credits are not convertible and their accounts are
not interchangeable.

- Each row shows the **account name, remaining credit**, and a **Test** and **Remove** button.
- The **Add account** button asks which product first, then opens that product's sign-in dialog.
- The block ends with the **per-product totals**, side by side and never added together.
- A rate-limited or out-of-quota account replaces its balance with "rate limited · retry in N min"; an account added by a pasted token shows "sign-in expired" once its token lapses.

The **models** below stay per product, each with its own grey heading, a refresh
button and the list's provenance (live / saved / built-in). Each row shows the model
name, its promotion badges and rate, and its context window.

**The context length is switchable**: when the upstream declares more than one
length for a model (200K / 1M, say), the row carries a sliding switch. Choosing
one **changes the request** — the plugin reports the chosen length to DSH, which
derives the model's output ceiling and context trimming from it. A model with a
single declared window gets no switch, because there is nothing to choose.

**Add account** first asks which product, then which sign-in method:

- **Scan to sign in** (CN only): a QR code to scan with the phone app, with an **Open sign-in page** button below it that opens the web sign-in in the **system browser**.
- **Sign-in token**: paste the console's token (the `AccessToken` string starting with `eyJ`). The plugin reads the name, uid, and expiry out of it and stores it **on this machine only**.

> **The international product shows no QR entry**: no mobile service completes its QR flow, so its routes are **Sign in on the web** (opens its console) and the pasted token.
>
> The browser route opens that product's login page automatically and then waits: once the sign-in completes on the web, the account is added here on its own, with no token to copy.

> **A pasted token cannot renew itself** (it carries no refresh token). When it expires, paste a fresh one; adding the same account again updates its token instead of creating a duplicate.


### Floating account window

A **floating window** sits in the top-right corner of the conversation, showing each version's accounts in use and their remaining credit; a set-aside account shows "retry in N min". The arrow in its corner collapses it, and the collapsed state is remembered. Turn it off from the settings card if you do not want it.

- **Rate**: every model name carries its credits multiplier (e.g. `GLM-5.2 · x0.79`, `Hy3 · x0.00`) in both the `/model` popup and the composer's model dropdown. The rate is display-only and never affects requests.

- **Promo badges**: promo badges (`限时免费`, `夜间折扣`) ride the model name itself (e.g. `Hy4 preview · x0.00 · 限时免费`), visible wherever you pick a model; the status card also collects currently-discounted models. Per the WorkBuddy service data, synced each time DSH starts. The international version's promotions come from the service's `modelPromotions` (which carry an effective window). Once a promotion lapses its badge is withdrawn; because the service writes the discounted value into the model's own rate field, the original price cannot be reconstructed, so that model then reports "price unavailable — refresh to update" rather than repeating the discounted rate or claiming the model is free.

The plugin card has three tabs: **Status** shows the account, token validity, total credit, catalog source, and reasoning-level detection; **Context** lists each model's context window (the international version distinguishes the default window from a larger selectable one); **Details** shows per-package credit and model offers. The account pool lives on the separate **DSH-WorkBuddy** settings page described above.

## Why reasoning levels work this way

Information about WorkBuddy models' reasoning levels is currently split between upstream API responses and private UI logic in the client, while the model catalog changes quickly. If the plugin filled in one uniform set of levels for every model without an upstream declaration, it would need to keep chasing unpublished product logic with no stable contract.

![Reasoning-level detection in the composer](assets/4.png)

Testing also found that some models accept the `reasoning_effort` parameter while ignoring unknown values and falling back to their default behavior. A successful request alone therefore does not prove that a level is actually usable.

For models without declared levels, Web and Desktop instead use user-authorized, on-demand detection: it first confirms that the upstream validates the parameter, then checks which standard levels it accepts. The check sends a few requests and may consume credit. Its result means only that the upstream currently accepts that level; it does not promise a particular change in reasoning quality, speed, or credit use.

## Install

Prerequisite: the WorkBuddy desktop app is installed and signed in. The plugin reuses the app's sign-in state and follows account switches automatically; the same applies to the international WorkBuddy AI app, and the two do not affect each other.

**Match the plugin version to your DSH core** — a mismatched combination fails to start DSH:

| Plugin | Required DSH core | Desktop app |
|---|---|---|
| **0.3.2+** (international support since `0.5.0`) | `0.1.5-rc.1` or newer | `2.0.7`+ (bundled core `0.1.5-rc.1`) |
| **0.3.0 – 0.3.1** | `0.1.2-rc.1` | `2.0.5` |
| **0.2.6** | `0.1.1-rc.2` (older line) | `2.0.3` / `2.0.4` |

- On DSH `0.1.5-rc.1` or newer, just install the latest: `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-connect`
- Still on DSH `0.1.2-rc.1`? Stay on `0.3.1`: `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-connect@0.3.1`
- Still on DSH `0.1.1-rc.2`? Stay on the older release: `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-connect@0.2.6`
- The desktop app has bundled `0.1.5-rc.1` since `2.0.7`, so it can use `0.3.2` and newer directly; `2.0.5` and earlier apps (bundled `0.1.2-rc.1`) should stay on `0.3.1`

The plugin runs under all three DSH interfaces: **Web**, **Desktop**, and **TUI**. Pick the install command that matches the profile you use.

```sh
# Web (recommended; ships prebuilt artifacts)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh web

# or install the Web version from the GitHub source
dsh plugin --profile web add github:corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh web
```

```sh
# Desktop (the DSH Desktop app)
dsh plugin --profile desktop add dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh --profile desktop
```

```sh
# TUI (terminal UI)
dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add dsh-workbuddy-connect
dsh --profile dsh-tui
```

> **TUI users, check the version pairing**: the terminal UI package (`@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui`) must be **`0.10.0-beta.5` or newer** — older versions fail at startup with `events is not iterable` when this plugin is installed. Update the shell first (via its built-in update command or a fresh install), then add this plugin; the newest release is a beta, and a stable one will work the same way.

> Manual reasoning-level detection is currently available only on Web and Desktop; TUI does not provide a detection action.

> Note: the `dsh-tui` profile requires pnpm 11 to install packages (a different pnpm on PATH fails with `ERR_PNPM_UNEXPECTED_STORE` — use `npx pnpm@11`).

After installing, switch to a WorkBuddy model in the model picker of the interface you chose. On Web and Desktop, the settings card shows the account, token validity, and remaining credit, can refresh the model list manually, and can check eligible models for reasoning levels; the CN and international versions each have their own card. On TUI, configure `authFile` in `/settings` (or `authFileAI` for the international version).

## CLI

`dsh plugin --profile <web|desktop|dsh-tui> exec dsh-workbuddy-connect status`: sign-in state and remaining credit (`--json` for machine-readable output; `doctor` for diagnostics and `logout` for credential cleanup are also available).

`dsh plugin --profile <web|desktop|dsh-tui> exec dsh-workbuddy-connect accounts`: lists the account pool (name, origin, balance, set-aside state). It is **read-only**, and exits 0 when the pool has an account and 1 when it is empty, so scripts can branch on it. Adding, removing, and editing accounts happens in the card UI.

Both commands target the CN version by default; add `--provider workbuddy-ai` for the international one:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-workbuddy-connect status --provider workbuddy-ai
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-workbuddy-connect doctor --provider workbuddy-ai
```

`logout` removes only that version's plugin-owned credential copy. It leaves the desktop app's own sign-in alone and does not promise the model group will disappear (the app's credential file still supplies one).

## Known limitations

- Verified on macOS with the DSH Web / Desktop / TUI profiles (as of 0.3.2 this requires `0.1.5-rc.1`+ and Node 22+; TUI requires the terminal UI package `0.10.0-beta.5` or newer — see the Install section). Windows probes Local and Roaming AppData in order; WSL first reads credentials from the mounted Windows user profile. If the Windows and Linux user names differ and Windows environment variables are not forwarded into WSL, point `WORKBUDDY_AUTH_FILE` (or `WORKBUDDY_AI_AUTH_FILE` for the international version) at the actual file.
- **The international version's model catalog comes from the app's own interface**: the service splits it by User-Agent, which is a private implementation detail that a server-side change can break. When that happens the plugin degrades to this account's last successful catalog and then to its built-in roster, showing the source (live / saved / built-in), the fetch time, and the failure reason on the card — but long-term compatibility is not guaranteed. The CN version's catalog uses the same interface as the official CLI and is unaffected.
- **International-version environments not yet covered**: on Windows / WSL / Linux no reliable source for the international app's version has been located yet, so the saved value or the built-in default is used. On macOS, real-shim checks covered complete GPT-family replies, tool calls, and continued turns.
- **Behaviour change with no credentials**: a version whose app was never signed in — and that left no plugin-owned copy — no longer shows a model group. The CN version used to display a built-in fallback list, but every model on it failed when selected.
- Relies on WorkBuddy client interfaces (not a public API); the plugin may need updates as WorkBuddy changes.
